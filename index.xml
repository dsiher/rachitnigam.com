&lt;p&gt;With the end of the Spring 2020 semester a month away, I have spent almost
two academic years at Cornell. A quick rundown of everything that happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;failures&#34;&gt;Failures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short paper on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cucapra/futil&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FuTIL&lt;/a&gt; rejected from LCTES ’20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejected from Facebook fellowship ’20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./publication/dahlia&#34;&gt;Dahlia&lt;/a&gt; rejected from ASPLOS ’20 with two weak rejects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejected from Microsoft research internship for summer ’19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejected from Qualcomm fellowship application ’19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejected from the Facebook fellowship ’19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rejected from the Symantec fellowship ’19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;successes&#34;&gt;Successes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short paper on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cucapra/diospyros&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Diospyros&lt;/a&gt; accepted to LCTES ’20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected as a finalist for the Qualcomm fellowship in ’20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./publication/dahlia&#34;&gt;Dahlia&lt;/a&gt; accepted to PLDI ’20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepted research internship at &lt;a href=&#34;frl&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/a&gt; for summer ’19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gave an invited talk to the Princeton Architecture and PL groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Created and ran the &lt;a href=&#34;great-pl&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Great works in PL&lt;/a&gt; seminar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ran the programming languages retreat in Fall ’19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2018&#34;&gt;Fall 2018&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started at Cornell and was terrified that I would not be able to find an
advisor. I set up meetings with the PL faculty and Cornell and decided to
do a rotation with &lt;a href=&#34;http://adriansampson.net&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adrian Sampson&lt;/a&gt; during the fall and switch to
working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nate Foster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian pitched me three projects: Use program synthesis
to automatically partition programs for reconfigurable architectures,
build a type system for a high-level programming language
for FPGAs, and a type system for graphics
and shader programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to work on the type system for FPGA programming (called Dahlia). I
was unsure that I would be a good fit for this project because I had no
background in computer architecture research. I hoped that my programming
languages experience would be useful for the project and that I could learn
enough about architecture to contribute to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started reading about FPGAs, implementing various features for the Dahlia
compiler, and writing down proofs for various type system properties.
I also got involved with the programming languages group and gave my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7190/2018fa/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first pldg talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed several language features for Dahlia. A particularly thorny
design issue was supporting complex iteration patterns while providing
type safety. We came up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/seashell/docs/view.html&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;memory
views&lt;/a&gt; to solve this.
The design of views felt inelegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I volunteered at OOPSLA 2019 in Boston where I met a lot of new and old
friends. I applied to industrial fellowships and was rejected from them.
Adrian said that they prefer to accept more senior students and that applying
was more important than being accepted. I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the semester I also realized that I was enjoying working on
Dahlia and asked Adrian to formally be my advisor. He agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;winter-2018&#34;&gt;Winter 2018&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to India for the winter break where I read a bunch of papers
and reviewed applications for PhD applicants. I convinced &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nate&lt;/a&gt; to
help me organize the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs7194/2019sp/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Great works in PL&lt;/a&gt; seminar as an excuse to
read classic PL papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spring-2019&#34;&gt;Spring 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to Cornell and started implementing memory views in Dahlia.
I kept feeling that the OCaml codebase was slowing me down so I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cucapra/dahlia/pull/46&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rewrote
Dahlia&lt;/a&gt; in Scala and implemented
memory views. The implementation demonstrated that views were inelegant
so we came up with a new implementation of memory views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing views turned out to be a lot more challenging than I originally
expected and it took me four tries to get it right. Before the final attempt,
we realized there was a fundamental problem with checking views that we didn&amp;rsquo;t
know how to solve. I was feeling particularly down that day. During my
walk back home, I discovered an elegant solution for compositionally reasoning
about views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge with Dahlia was finding the right pitch for it.
We had some idea that it made hardware designs &amp;ldquo;more predictable&amp;rdquo; because
each language construct had a direct hardware mapping. However, we didn&amp;rsquo;t
know how to demonstrate this &amp;ldquo;predictability&amp;rdquo;. I was wary of qualitative
arguments. I spent the semester writing code and text. We started porting
an FPGA programming benchmark suite to Dahlia to see how it faired with larger
examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the background, I decided to do a summer internship that year and started
interviewed with MSR and Facebook Reality Labs (FRL). MSR rejected me and I
eventually accepted an offer from the silicon research team at FRL. I
also attended ASPLOS 2019 with Adrian and made a lot
of new architecture friends. Architects seemed to be livelier than PL
people because they&amp;rsquo;re living on the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_data_graph_execution&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EDGE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summer-2019&#34;&gt;Summer 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent my summer in Redmond at FRL using program synthesis to solve hardware
problems. Working on program synthesis is a roller coaster: the
solver gives you solutions and you&amp;rsquo;re happy. At some point it stops scaling
and you don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do anymore and everything is sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrote a few short sections for the Dahlia paper hoping to hit the
ASPLOS 2020 deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2019&#34;&gt;Fall 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team at FRL sufficiently liked my project to ask me to continue working
on an offshoot. I realized that if I worked on a program synthesis project
alone, I would be sad all the time. I asked &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~avh/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alexa VanHattum&lt;/a&gt; if
she wanted to collaborate on it with me and she said yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew back to Ithaca a week before the ASPLOS 2020 deadline fully expecting
to miss the deadline since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of content in the paper.
Adrian said we should hit the deadline so I switched gears into paper
writing mode. We wrote a paper in a week and submitted it to ASPLOS. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
expect the paper to get in because of a weak evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central problem with the evaluation was that it simply reimplemented C++
benchmarks in Dahlia which resulted in the same area and latency numbers
as the baselines. The evaluation didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything interesting about how
Dahlia enabled &amp;ldquo;predictable hardware design&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;which was the title of
our paper. I was starting to feel angsty about the project and felt like there
was no way evaluate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was burned out from the paper writing so I asked my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://samginzburg.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sam
Ginzburg&lt;/a&gt; to host me at Princeton for a week. He recommended that I
give a talk to the architecture group which was a great idea but destroyed
my plans of not working during the Princeton visit. I visited Princeton, gave
a talk, and met a lot of cool people. Sam was working on a measurement project
and had a lot of pretty graphs. I decided that the only way to calm my angst
with Dahlia was to perform measurements and quantify predictability. I did
not yet know how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued spending my time implementing the compiler and getting the
benchmarks running. During an auspicious trip to the Applications Driving
Architecture (ADA) symposium, I came up with a plan to show that Dahlia enabled
predictable design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a hardware design and enumerate all the design points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run all the points and extract statistics (area and latency).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show that the subset of design points Dahlia accepts smoothly trade off
area for latency and are therefore &amp;ldquo;predictable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenging part of this plan was getting all the data. A back-of-the-envelope
calculation showed that we&amp;rsquo;d need a few months of compute time to
get all the data. I had, unfortunately, reached a point where I needed to
build a distributed experimentation framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to work building the framework on top of an existing in-house benchmarking
server. It took me three weeks of relentless Python hacking to get multiple
AWS machines to run FPGA designs. Once we had that, pretty graphs started
rolling out and I started confirming various claims about Dahlia quantitatively.
Around this time, Dahlia was rejected from ASPLOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this was expected, I was still sad for a few days. We decided to resubmit
to PLDI. With three weeks to go, I ran the capstone
experiment: enumerate 32,000 points and run them on the 80 workers. I
calculated that it would take 5 days to finish the jobs. I ran into numerous
issues like &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; being too slow, job uploads taking three days, and monitoring
scripts DDoS-ing the servers. I babysat the servers, painfully restarting
dead workers and failed jobs, and eventually got the
results. The graphs looked pretty and validated Dahlia&amp;rsquo;s claims. I was very
tired but happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the last week while writing and finishing up the final experiments, I
started staying late in the office. Three days before the deadline (Nov 19),
I finished all the experiments and got cookies at midnight to celebrate this.
After the cookies, I decided to bike back to home. I
started biking down 2am. At 2.05am, I fell from my bike during a sharp turn
and broke my left wrist. My roommate took me the ER where I got a splint. I was heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up the next day and went into the lab after getting a proper arm cast.
I could no longer type on a keyboard so I started handwriting the edits to
the paper which my co-authors then put into the paper. At 1am on November 23,
we &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/notypes/status/1198111419704717312&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; the
Dahlia paper to PLDI 2020. I was unsure if the paper would get in but I was
proud of the work we had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semester rolled on and I started brainstorming ideas with Alexa and FRL
on a new project. We decided to use program synthesis to generate
high-performance kernels for DSPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;winter-2019&#34;&gt;Winter 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back home to India to recuperate from the broken arm. I proposed
submitting a Qualcomm fellowship proposal for our DSP project. We quickly
hacked up a demo project (called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cucapra/diospyros&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Diospyros&lt;/a&gt;) and submitted the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spring-2020&#34;&gt;Spring 2020&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to Cornell in the spring. Doctor told me that while my broken wrist
bone had healed, a cartilage tear in my wrist might never properly heal. I
wondered if a paper submission was worth a lifelong injury (it wasn&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semester rolled on and we were accepted for stage 2 of the Qualcomm
proposal. We continued hacking on the project and wrote an even stronger stage 2
proposal with real graphs. Emboldened by the success, we also decided to write
a work-in-progress paper for LCTES 2020. In parallel, I joined another project
to build an intermediate language (called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cucapra/futil&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FuTIL&lt;/a&gt;) for compiling high-level
languages to hardware circuits. I convinced my collaborators for that project
to submit an LCTES paper as well. We wrote two very good papers and submitted
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime PLDI reviews came back and they were incredibly positive:
two strong accepts and two weak
accepts. Adrian said it was almost certainly enough to get into PLDI. We
wrote up a rebuttal and submitted it. Two weeks later, Dahlia was accepted
to PLDI 2020. Another week after the acceptance I submitted an artifact to
the PLDI artifact evaluation committee. I also volunteered for the committee
and reviewed some cool artifacts in the following weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was generally happier about things, especially since I had published my first
grad school paper. However, at the start of March, everything turned upside
down. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, Cornell shut down its campus and PLDI
transformed into a virtual conference. I felt sad that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able
to give a talk on Dahlia in paper. Sad enough to write a &lt;a href=&#34;./post/virtual-cs-conferences/&#34;&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into working from home and adjusting to our new reality, we heard
back from LCTES. The paper on Diospyros is accepted while the one on FuTIL is
rejected. We also hear back from Qualcomm saying that we made it to the final
stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first two years in grad school were a lot of expected and unexpected things.
The ups and downs of research were expected. The ups and downs of life were
not (injuries and global pandemics). This post leaves out a lot of my personal
accomplishments: I made a lot of friends, I took up biking and baking, I got
healthier, etc. Submitting my first paper was a big accomplishment for me but
I don&amp;rsquo;t I like the way I got to it. I sacrificed my personal health (due to
my own work ethic) and injured myself. Going forward, I want to set better
boundaries and think harder about the trade-offs between my life and my
research. I am grateful to the many people who made my first two years at
Cornell bearable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cost of virtualizing CS conferences</title>
      <link>/post/virtual-cs-conferences/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 23:15:05 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/virtual-cs-conferences/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Conferences in computer science are an odd occurrence. Unlike most other
research fields which primarily focus on publishing in journals, conferences
ended up being the primary publication and presentation venue in CS. They also
became the place where researchers network with each other,
learn about ongoing research, and drink beer with their grad school buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, conference presentations and networking play an incredibly
important part of a junior researcher&amp;rsquo;s career. Conferences allow us to show
our research to our community and have other people learn about us. In my field
of research, programming languages and systems, it takes anywhere between one
year to multiple years to complete a project. Add to that yearly deadlines and
specialized venues which results in a junior PhD student having anywhere from
two to four presentations before they go on the job market. Our recognition in
our community from our presentations and our papers is what gets us invitation
for interviews and job offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, with the outbreak of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, our world has been turned
upside down. Beyond the incredible amounts of fear, uncertainty, and human
suffering it has caused, it has also destroyed one of the core mechanisms of
conducting science&amp;mdash;meeting people. Multiple major academic conferences
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://asplos-conference.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASPLOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/virtual&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICLR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PLDI/status/1240401711124090883&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PLDI&lt;/a&gt;) have been canceled. Junior researchers, who had
decided to go on job markets, find internships, or visit another institutions
have had to cancel all of their plans. The impact of these things is
unquantifiable&amp;mdash;how does one measure the effect of a missed serendipitous
research collaboration, or that one person on a hiring committee hearing about
your work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am not here to complain about missed conferences. Canceling
conferences in the midst of a global pandemic is &lt;em&gt;the right thing&lt;/em&gt; to do.
I instead want to figure out how we as a community can recreate the
opportunities that conferences create for us every year. I am not an expert in
this so I will need help. I have attempted to summarize the crucial
opportunities conferences give us, what the challenges of running a virtual
conferences are, and what options we have given that physical meetings are out
of the question for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals-of-a-conference&#34;&gt;Goals of a conference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my (second-year PhD student in a relatively small community) perspective,
conferences traditionally satisfy the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissemination of research&lt;/strong&gt;: The primary goal of any conference is to allow
researchers to present their work to their peers and discuss it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcoming new researchers&lt;/strong&gt;: The bloodline of our communities are new
researchers. From undergrads who are attending conferences for the first
time to PhD student presenting their research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Hallway&amp;rdquo; track&lt;/strong&gt;: Well understood to be the actual primary goal of
any conference, the hallway track is the colloquial name for researchers
hanging out with each other and discussing research and whatever else that
comes to their mind. It allows us to build long term connections within our
community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;options-for-virtual-conferences&#34;&gt;Options for Virtual conferences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that most health organizations have recommended that non-essential
travel be suspended, our only choice is to have virtual conferences in some
format. Virtual formats present several challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple time-zones&lt;/strong&gt;: Since researchers are not directly traveling to
one physical location for the conference, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume they will
distributed across the world in different time-zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of commitment&lt;/strong&gt;: As a friend of mine put it, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to set aside
the time to interact with presenters (who are possibly remote) when there
are other commitments like teaching a class or having research meetings.
Physical conferences act as a forcing function to set this time aside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these problems are challenging to solve. Following are some proposals
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen discussed/implemented at currently canceled conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recorded presentations&lt;/strong&gt;: The bare minimum any conference can do to
satisfy the first goal is to have authors record research talks and upload
them to YouTube. This will allow researchers to reach out to the people who
are most interested in their work and already know about it, but not a wider
audience that a physical conference gives access to. It might also be
possible to welcome new researchers through videos but they&amp;rsquo;d likely feel
impersonal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chatrooms for discussing papers&lt;/strong&gt;: In addition to uploading all the talks
to YouTube, &lt;a href=&#34;https://asplos-conference.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASPLOS 20&lt;/a&gt; created a Slack channel to discuss
each paper and co-located workshops. This improves the possibility of direct
interactions by making community members available in the same place.
Unfortunately, there really is no way of creating the hallway track in such
a setup. As a junior student, it might be hard or impossible to get
introductions to/talk to other researchers when they are not present in
person. Furthermore, because of the asynchronous nature of chatrooms, it
might be hard to have detailed conversations with people in different
timezones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Livestreaming the conference&lt;/strong&gt;: Livestreaming the conference in real time
brings the experience as close to a conference session as possible. People
are required to commit time beforehand and ask questions to right after
a talk. Setting this up is non-trivial owing to time zone issues. Again,
while this provides the opportunity for more direct conversations, there
doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a good way to recreate a hallway track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postpone the conference/Merge it with another&lt;/strong&gt;: The nuclear option of
pushing back the conference and waiting out the pandemic. By definition,
this will recreate the experience of a conference. However, this would be
incredibly hard to do since conferences are carefully planned to not overlap
with other conferences in relevant areas. A different approach might to be
have a bigger conference the next year and have papers from both &lt;em&gt;this year&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;next year&lt;/em&gt; be presented there. Again, I imagine this would be a
nightmare to organize. It also fundamentally cannot recreate opportunities
for researchers who go on the job market this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the solutions here are perfect and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know which one to choose.
Each of these require hard trade-offs that we, as a community, have to make.
The lack of conferences and the opportunities they create is not measurable
which makes it easier to ignore their impact. I really hope that we can
come up with a solution that is cognizant of this and takes into consideration
the people most impacted by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A personal note&lt;/strong&gt;: I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/dahlia&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; accepted at PLDI 20. This
is my first first-author paper and I have been incredibly excited to present
this work for a really long time. I always imagined my first presentation
to an exciting and terrifying rite of passage that I would celebrate with
my friends, colleagues, and advisors. I feel a deep sense of loss, almost
as if all the hard work was &amp;ldquo;zeroed out&amp;rdquo; because I can&amp;rsquo;t present it anymore.
I assume other people in my situation feel similarly. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if senior
researchers put this much value in conference presentations (since they&amp;rsquo;ve
already given so many) but it seems important to acknowledge this feeling that
junior researchers have when we come up with solutions for virtual conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Collaborations in systems research is how I&amp;rsquo;ve built some of the best tools
in my research. A larger teams means an expanded vision and being able to pursue more
ambitious ideas but it also incurs an overhead &amp;ndash; team management. Effectively
managing a team and keeping all team members up to date can be stressful and a
daunting task. I think one way to approaching management tasks is by asking
a few concrete questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the primary channel of communication?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often should we be meeting? What are the preparing expectations for a meeting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are we managing our code base? What are the expectations about code knowledge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are we managing our TODO items?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should we resolve conflicts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions should evolve with a project. For example, a
project in its prototyping stage might have no restrictions on how or where the
code is kept but a more mature project associated with other projects or
deployments requires careful releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections answer these questions from my experience with teams.
The answers apply for a reasonably mature project with most core infrastructure
decisions already made (which language to use, which toolchains, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m not the most experienced developer in the world, I would appreciate any suggestions (find my contact information at the end of the post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;primary-communication&#34;&gt;Primary Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an easy one. Teams can either use email threads or one of the dozens
of chat applications to have conversations about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using a emails is that the team can keep track of individual
threads of conversations easily. However, with multiple projects, this might
get unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat apps, on the other hand, make it really quick and easy to communicate with
the team but are usually bad at maintaining separate threads of conversations
cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of the primary communication is often already constrained by group
preferences so this is usually a straightforward decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, team members should try to have long conversations in person.
Text based mediums make it really hard to accurately convey emotions and it
is easy to misread an offhand comment as being aggressive (I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly been
guilty of this!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;meetings&#34;&gt;Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings act as a synchronization point for the entire team and require some amount
of preparation. I suggest having at least two team meetings every week, one
with your advisor (main meeting) and one without them (student meeting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;main-meeting&#34;&gt;Main meeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the main meeting, every student should be prepared with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short weekly update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical challenges faced during the assigned task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions or gotchas found during the assigned the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the main meeting, each student should leave with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one assigned task for the week. This can be a paper to read and explain, feature to implement, or a theorem to prove.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good sense of where to look for answers to their questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of students (myself included) struggle with prioritizing tasks. Students
involved in research have tons of unstructured time which is not utilized
effectively without a good plan. Assigned tasks help me focus on a task that
I need to get done every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concretely, I try every week to either complete the tasks assigned to me or
have technical questions that are blocking me ready for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;student-meeting&#34;&gt;Student meeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student meetings are more informal and are meant for in depth discussions
about small issues that team members are facing in completing their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;codebases&#34;&gt;Codebases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working on an applied systems project chances are you are building
a software artifact. Regardless of how many people are writing code, it is useful to
check in the code into &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source
control&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the code
publicly viewable and commentable by the team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level principle behind these guidelines is to minimize the number of locations where critical information such as feature discussions are kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I primarily use &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rachitnigam&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, the following guidelines assume your
project is Github-based. When working on a artifact, I have the following
expectations with team members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project leaders (graduate students or senior undergrads) should have a
good sense of what is going on with every aspect of the codebase. This means
having a high-level understanding of all pull requests and issue discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-branches&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;branches&lt;/a&gt;. Working
on big features on a separate branch allows other people to work in parallel
while leaving the code in a buildable state. Pull requests are a great way
to get the team&amp;rsquo;s attention on a big change and center discussions around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the git history clean by using &lt;code&gt;git pull -r&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-rebase&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rebasing&lt;/a&gt; instead of
merging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;todo-list&#34;&gt;TODO List&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most of my projects revolve around a software artifact, most of which
are on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rachitnigam&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, I use Github issues as
a tracking list. Other people I have worked with also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; or one of the dozens of TODO apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The todo list should make it easy to create tasks and have discussions around them and also allow team members to see who is working on what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the development phase of the project, I ask the team to use
issues liberally. The term &amp;ldquo;global tracker&amp;rdquo; refers to the high level view of
all todo items. On Github, this is simply the issues page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, I divide issues into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trackers&lt;/strong&gt;. Trackers are a collection of smaller issues that logically belong
together but might pollute the global tracker. Use these for reading lists,
benchmark status, and low priority tasks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cucapra/seashell/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue+label%3ATracker+&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;. Proposal are the heart of the global tracker. Use proposals to
discuss system features, implementation sketches, or big bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;: These include questions or small bugs. These should be
high frequency, i.e. created liberally, and answered quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conflict-resolution&#34;&gt;Conflict resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an often overlooked dimension of team dynamics. Research projects can
often be stressful, especially since students tend to be ambitious and prone
to overworking. Since this process so highly dependent on the team members
and project leads, my guideline can only be personalized for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a team member feels under too much pressure to do something or dislikes
someone&amp;rsquo;s personal behavior, they can either directly contact the person or
ask one of the team leads to mediate. While daunting, it is much better in the
long run to have frank discussions about team expectations and stresses instead
of letting things get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are several industrial strength methodologies for team managements,
I like having a much more lightweight team management style. A lot of research
is about exploring new ideas and pursuing crazy ideas. Regardless of which
guidelines you choose to follow, they should not take away the joy of programming
or research!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning to Fail</title>

&lt;p&gt;I often describe the basic philosophy of research using a metaphor: bash your
head in a wall over and over till you find a way to
break it and then repeat it ad nauseam. Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll know where the
cracks in the wall are, and sometime you&amp;rsquo;ll know what angle you need to hit the
wall with your head, but fundamentally, you&amp;rsquo;re hitting your head into a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps an unnecessarily graphic description of what research is
like but the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get across is that &lt;em&gt;research is hard&lt;/em&gt; and
that &lt;em&gt;failure is the expected outcome&lt;/em&gt;. The primary skill of researcher is
not their ability to come up with good ideas or write code but to persevere
in the face of continuous failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My undergraduate research experience is the primary reason that I skill. I
started research early but I failed. In fact, I failed almost every single
project I worked on. But this failure also removed any illusions of what
research is like and helped me redefine what &amp;ldquo;success&amp;rdquo; should mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick summary of my research experience as an undergrad:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spring-2016&#34;&gt;Spring 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out a my undergraduate advisor in my first semester after being
fascinated with Scheme&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After some back and forth, I quickly started
a project. The project was to build a formal semantics for bash scripts. The
bash specification is large and complicated with a lot of subtle interactions.
The particular phase we were interested in formalizing were the bash shell
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;expansions&lt;/a&gt;. We tried to build a Hoare logic style semantics for the expansion, because
we wanted to ultimately verify properties of these shell scripts. Unfortunately,
I showed that such a semantics becomes super complicated and we abandoned the
project&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A few weeks into research and I had already failed a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summer-2016&#34;&gt;Summer 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back for the summer and started working on a new, and slightly related
project. The idea was to extend previous work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/papers/2016-rehearsal.html&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;verifying Puppet
manifests&lt;/a&gt; to
capture the semantics of snippets of shell programs people write into their
Puppet manifests. The previous work had modeled Puppet programs using a
small core calculus based on a Kleene Algebra with Tests (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/Papers/kat.pdf&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KAT&lt;/a&gt;) and we wanted to create an active learning
mechanism to learn the underlying automaton by running the shell script in
a docker container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of background in either automata theory or
the low level details of system call tracing (which was the core mechanism to
figure out what system calls were being used). I spent half of the summer
jumping back and forth between learning about automata theory and systems and
implementing papers without much to show for it. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this
at the time, this project also fizzled out around this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason the project fizzled out was because I joined another student&amp;rsquo;s
project where we were trying to automatically synthesize updates for Puppet
manifests by capturing system calls. I worked on this project for the rest
of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2016&#34;&gt;Fall 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the summer ended, my advisor proposed joining Fission, another project that
I had been interested in from the start of my summer. This project aimed to
build a single-tiered, secure programming model for writing web applications.
People on the project had built a frontend that could take JavaScript code and
compile it into something that could enforces security conditions.
Around the same time, the Puppet synthesis project slowed down because the
first author was applying to graduate schools and I was focusing more on
Fission. Eventually, I stopped working on Puppet synthesis entirely and even
though it was eventually published&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cap off the depressing string of half completed projects, it was around this
time I actually had minor clinical depression and my productivity collapsed. After
attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2016&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICFP &amp;lsquo;16&lt;/a&gt; I decided to
start therapy to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; my clinical depression&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we also published a &lt;a href=&#34;http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7124/pdf/LIPIcs-SNAPL-2017-5.pdf&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;workshop
paper&lt;/a&gt;
on Fission. Unfortunately, after several rewrites of the compiler, people
leaving the project, and fundamental performance issues, it was becoming
painfully clear that Fission would not pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re keeping track, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for failed projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spring-2017&#34;&gt;Spring 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While making slow progress on Fission, my advisor asked a new question, &amp;ldquo;What
would it take to build a client-side IDE?&amp;ldquo;. In order to build this IDE, we
started investigating different compiler frameworks for JavaScript. We built
multiple passes to simplify JavaScript constructs and around the same time, another
graduate student joined the project. This spring was perhaps the most productive
semester of my undergraduate research career. I had gained enough technical
and programming chops to push on the project without hands-on support. By the
end of this semester, we had managed to build an IDE and give a talk about it
at &lt;a href=&#34;https://nepls.org/Events/31/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;NEPLS &amp;lsquo;17&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summer-2017&#34;&gt;Summer 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advisor was going to be away for most the summer and he recommended that
I do an &amp;ldquo;academic internship&amp;rdquo;. I emailed a professor at Brown University who
took me in for the summer. After a meeting with him during spring break, I
convinced him to let me continue working on my spring research by promising
to integrate my work into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pyret.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pyret&lt;/a&gt; programming
language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a summer trying to improve the performance of our implementation
which didn&amp;rsquo;t work out. However, my collaborator back at UMass had figured
out a solution so continued pushing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the summer, I started looking into integrating our work with
Pyret. The codebase of a production-ready compiler like Pyret that supports
thousands of users every day was daunting and hard to understand by myself.
I spent about two weeks trying to understand it, and frustrated at my lack of
progress, also wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rachitnigam/pyret-lang.vim&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Vim plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Pyret. Once I understood the code base, it took me two days to
implement the first part of the integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fall-2017&#34;&gt;Fall 2017&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summer came to an end and my most stressful semester in undergraduate began.
I was graduating in three years so I was taking 6 classes, applying
to 10 graduate schools, applying for summer internships, and writing a paper
for our research. It was a lot of work but I did it all. We submitted a
polished paper to PLDI 2018 (which was later &lt;a href=&#34;./publication/stopify&#34;&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt;).
I was accepted to 8 graduate schools and a software engineering internship
at Google. I eventually decided to start my PhD at Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent a few years at Cornell, I have come to appreciate a lot of things
about my undergraduate experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I failed for more than a year, I learned &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. The
amount of implementation work I did made me good at rapid prototyping and
I came with a breadth of knowledge in configuration and web languages,
secure systems, and formal language theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The infectious optimism of my advisor kept me going through all the failures.
The most important piece of advice he gave me was: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned that I work best when I collaborate with people. It is easier
to be excited about research when someone else is also excited about it
with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is really hard to execute research ideas. A lot of people can come up
with really good ideas but it takes a lot of work and dedication to
push through a project. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to respect the latter way more than the
former.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel privileged in having a undergraduate research career where I was
given the opportunity to fail. When I started my PhD, I had no illusions
about what research was: it requires a religious amount of faith and hard work
before you can see any progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PhD @ Cornell: The Free Agent system</title>

&lt;p&gt;Deciding which graduate school you&amp;rsquo;re going to spend the next &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; years of your
life is one of the hardest decision of your life. One of the things
that made is hard for me was deciding between Cornell and my other
top choice was Cornell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Free agent system&amp;rdquo;. Here is a short post about what
the system is and why it worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;graduate-school-admissions&#34;&gt;Graduate School Admissions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most schools in the US, when you apply to a PhD program, students are usually
picked out by one or more professors who think you&amp;rsquo;d be a good fit. After
visiting the school, the student decides which professor they want to work with
and commit to the school. When the student starts at the school, they are
funded by the professor and they start doing great things together. However,
some schools don&amp;rsquo;t follow this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cornell-s-free-agent-system&#34;&gt;Cornell&amp;rsquo;s Free Agent System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Cornell, and a few other schools, the admission process looks a bit
different.  When a PhD student is admitted to Cornell, they are are &lt;em&gt;admitted
to the department&lt;/em&gt;, which highlights Cornell&amp;rsquo;s commitment towards the student&amp;rsquo;s
academic freedom. Concretely, this means that Cornell guarantees funding,
usually through teaching assistantship, for the student without tying them to
an advisor [^1].  This is supposed to allow the students to explore and talk to
potential advisors without being worried about funding. This is the Free Agent
system at Cornell. Students are free agents till they decide who they want to
work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cornell&amp;rsquo;s free agent system was devised when the department was young and the
incoming PhD students tended to have comparatively less research experience.
The free agent system allowed students to explore different areas without
being pressured into working on topics they might disliked. However, in the recent
years, the makeup of people applying to PhD programs has drastically changed &amp;mdash;
students tend to come in with a lot more research experience and are usually
quite certain about the area they want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the CS department is also structured in a way that assumes
students are free agents their first year. This means that they are expected to
&lt;del&gt;take a lot of classes and&lt;/del&gt; [^1] be teaching assistants (TAs) in their first
two semesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free agent system caused me a lot of angst during the decision process. For
some background, I had started doing programming languages (PL) research in the
first semester of my undergraduate degree and was certain about my future research
direction. Furthermore, I knew that Cornell was the best fit for my interest in
doing PL work at the intersection of other fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was also afraid of not being able to find an advisor. After
about 6 hours of post visit day talks with professors and students in the PL
group, I decided to go to Cornell. Even after my acceptance, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if
I&amp;rsquo;d be able to find an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started in Fall, I emailed professors in the PL group to set up
meetings. This is where I found the true strength of the free agent system.
Since professors expect students to go talk to a lot of people, they expect and
often encourage students to do research rotations with professors they are
interested in working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes it easy to reach out to professors and learn about their work. I
cannot emphasize how important it is to me to learn about and have
conversations about research in different domains. One of my goals going into a
PhD is to have a broad sense of the different kinds of problems in different
domains and having access to professors in different areas makes it easy to do
so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to start working with my awesome advisor &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adrian
Sampson&lt;/a&gt; and we quickly found a project
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;caveat-emptor&#34;&gt;Caveat Emptor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the free agent system caused me some anguish in the decision process, it
was not the primary reason I decided join Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My primary motivators were research that excited me, and people &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who are
just as excited about it as me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first year TAing requirement causes some amount of stress for
new students. However, the department is aware of the issues and is
trying to move away from this system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a more &lt;a href=&#34;http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2009/02/some-notes-on-picking-grad.html&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;detailed

&lt;a href=&#34;http://jeanyang.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jean Yang&lt;/a&gt; on what considerations matter when deciding
on schools. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don’t be Programming Languages researchers</title>
      <link>/post/pl-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 21:52:05 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/pl-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of being a judgement of what PL research should be, this short post is
simply a reflection of my research interests and what role PL plays into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent PLDG talk, the speaker said, &amp;ldquo;I think that, as a community, PL
people have a moral responsibility to step in and say, ‘No, you&amp;rsquo;re having fun
wrong!’&amp;rdquo; While I have no qualms about the comment itself (jokes can be useful
tool in presentations), it led me to think about the
way PL research is applied in new domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a classic programming languages presentation, the speaker starts with an
overview of a domain, talks about the current state of the art of
programming languages and tools in it, and then go on to point out that most
tools and languages fail to make use of amazing and well-known PL
techniques. Then they describe their work which applies the aforementioned PL
technique and build cool and interesting language abstractions with the promise
of building better and improved tools for the domain&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I strongly endorse PL techniques and research being applied in new
domains, this story demonstrates a fundamental issue for me: Application of PL techniques is
done retrospectively. PL researchers are not there when a domain is shaping up
and people trying to build tools and programming languages for that domain.
Only once people have made build these tools, which in turn cement
themselves into domain, do PL researchers come into the scene and apply their
cool techniques&amp;mdash;at a point where practitioners are unlikely to adopt something
new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my solution: We should stop being PL researchers&amp;mdash;we should take it
upon themselves to learn about new domains and apply ourselves well before
the standards are established.
Programming
languages are the fundamental way of communicating intent to computers. As
PL researchers, we should be actively helping people from other domains, not
waiting for them to realize the error of their ways and come to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;It is rarely the case that the tool or language proposed actually solves the problems in the motivation. &lt;em&gt;Yes, do tell me how your tiny language will stop Google from going down twice a year.&lt;/em&gt;
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;↩&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
