&lt;p&gt;Conferences in computer science are an odd occurrence. Unlike most other
research fields which primarily focus on publishing in journals, conferences
are the primary way for research to discuss and disseminate their research.
They are also the primary way for researcher to network with each other,
learn about ongoing research, and drink beer with their grad school buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes conference presentations an incredibly important part of a junior
researchers career. Conferences allow us to show our research to our community
and have other people learn about us. In my field of research, programming
languages and systems, it takes anywhere between one year to multiple years to
complete a project. Add to that yearly deadlines and specialized venues which
results in a junior PhD student having anywhere from two to four presentations
before they go on the job market. Our recognition in our community, from our
presentations and our papers is what gets us invitation for interviews and
job offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, with the outbreak of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, our worlds have been turned
upside down. Beyond the incredible amounts of fear, uncertainty, and human
suffering it has caused, it has also destroyed one of the core mechanisms of
conducting science&amp;mdash;meeting people. Multiple major academic conferences
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://asplos-conference.org/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ASPLOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020/virtual&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICLR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/PLDI/status/1240401711124090883&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PLDI&lt;/a&gt;) have been canceled. Junior researchers, who had
decided to go on job markets, find internships, or visit another institutions
have had to cancel all of their plans. The impact of these things is
unquantifiable&amp;mdash;how does one measure the effect of a missed serendipitous
research collaboration, or that one person on a hiring committee hearing about
your work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am not here to complain about missed conferences. Canceling
conferences in the midst of a global pandemic is &lt;em&gt;the right thing&lt;/em&gt; to do.
I instead what to figure out how we as a community can recreate the
opportunities that conferences have created for us. I am not an expert in this
so I will need help. I have attempted to summarize the crucial opportunities
conferences give us and what options we have given that physical meetings are
out of question for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals-of-a-conference&#34;&gt;Goals of a conference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my (second year PhD student in a relatively small community) perspective,
conferences traditionally satisfy the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissemination of research&lt;/strong&gt;: The primary goal of any conference is to allow
researchers to present their work to their peers and discuss it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcoming new researchers&lt;/strong&gt;: The bloodline of our communities are new
researchers. From undergrads who are attending conferences for the first
time to PhD student presenting their research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Hallway&amp;rdquo; track&lt;/strong&gt;: Well understood to be the actual primary goal of
any conference, the hallway track is the colloquial name for researchers
hanging out with each other and discussing research and whatever else that
comes to their mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;options-for-virtual-conferences&#34;&gt;Options for Virtual conferences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that most health organizations have recommended that non-essential
travel be suspended, our only choice is to have virtual conferences in some
format. Virtual formats present several challenges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple time-zones&lt;/strong&gt;: Since researcher are not directly traveling to
one physical location for the conference, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume they will
distributed across the world in different time-zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of commitment&lt;/strong&gt;: As a friend of mine put it, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to set aside
the time to interact with presenters (who are possible remote) when there
are other commitments like teaching a class or having research meetings.
Physical conferences act as a forcing function to set this aside time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are some proposals I&amp;rsquo;ve seen discussed/implemented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recorded presentations&lt;/strong&gt;: The bare minimum any conference can do to
satisfy the first goal is to have authors record research talks and upload
them to YouTube. This will allow researchers to perhaps reach out to the
people who are most interested in their work and are already interested
in it, but nothing beyond that. It might also be possible to welcome new
researchers through videos but they&amp;rsquo;d likely feel impersonal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chatrooms for discussing papers&lt;/strong&gt;: In addition to uploading all the talks
to YouTube, [ASPLOS 20] created a slack channel to discuss each paper and
each co-located workshop. This has the benefit of allowing more interactions
with researchers by asking questions. While this improves on the first
design, there really is no way of creating the hallway track is such a setup.
As a junior student, it might be hard to cold DM someone you where looking
forward to talking to but don&amp;rsquo;t already know. Furthermore, because of the
asynchronous nature of chatrooms, it might be hard to have detailed
conversations with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Livestreaming the conference&lt;/strong&gt;: Livestreaming the conference in real time
brings the experience as close to a conference session as possible. People
are required to commit time beforehand and ask questions to right after
a talk. Setting this up is non-trivial owing to time zone issues. Again,
while this provides the opportunity for more direct conversations, there
doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem a good way to recreate a hallway track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postpone the conference&lt;/strong&gt;: The nuclear option of pushing back the
conference and waiting out the pandemic. By definition, this will recreate
the experience of a conference. However, this would be incredibly hard to
do since conferences are carefully planned to not overlap with other
conferences in relevant areas. A different approach might to be have a
bigger conference the next year and have papers from both &lt;em&gt;this year&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;next year&lt;/em&gt; be presented there. Again, I imagine this would be a nightmare
to organize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the solutions here are perfect and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know which one to choose.
Each of these require hard trade-offs that we, as a community, have to make.
The lack of conferences and the opportunities they create is not measurable
which makes it easier to ignore their impact. I really hope that we can
come up with a solution that is cognizant of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short personal note&lt;/strong&gt;: I had &lt;a href=&#34;https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/dahlia&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; accepted at PLDI 20. This
is my first first-author paper and I had been incredibly excited to present
this work for a really long time. I always imagined my first presentation
to an exciting and terrifying rite of passage that I would celebrate with
my friends, colleagues, and advisors. I feel a deep sense of loss, almost
as if all the hard work was &amp;ldquo;zeroed out&amp;rdquo; because I can&amp;rsquo;t present it anymore.
I assume other people in my situation feel similarly. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if senior
researchers put this much value in conference presentations (since they&amp;rsquo;ve
already given so many) but it seems important to acknowledge this when we
come up with solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project Management for PhD Students</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Collaborations in systems research is how I&amp;rsquo;ve built some of the best tools
in my research. A larger teams means an expanded vision and being able to pursue more
ambitious ideas but it also incurs an overhead &amp;ndash; team management. Effectively
managing a team and keeping all team members up to date can be stressful and a
daunting task. I think one way to approaching management tasks is by asking
a few concrete questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the primary channel of communication?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How often should we be meeting? What are the preparing expectations for a meeting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are we managing our code base? What are the expectations about code knowledge?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are we managing our TODO items?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should we resolve conflicts?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions should evolve with a project. For example, a
project in its prototyping stage might have no restrictions on how or where the
code is kept but a more mature project associated with other projects or
deployments requires careful releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following sections answer these questions from my experience with teams.
The answers apply for a reasonably mature project with most core infrastructure
decisions already made (which language to use, which toolchains, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m not the most experienced developer in the world, I would appreciate any suggestions (find my contact information at the end of the post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;primary-communication&#34;&gt;Primary Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an easy one. Teams can either use email threads or one of the dozens
of chat applications to have conversations about the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using a emails is that the team can keep track of individual
threads of conversations easily. However, with multiple projects, this might
get unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat apps, on the other hand, make it really quick and easy to communicate with
the team but are usually bad at maintaining separate threads of conversations
cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice of the primary communication is often already constrained by group
preferences so this is usually a straightforward decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, team members should try to have long conversations in person.
Text based mediums make it really hard to accurately convey emotions and it
is easy to misread an offhand comment as being aggressive (I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly been
guilty of this!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;meetings&#34;&gt;Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings act as a synchronization point for the entire team and require some amount
of preparation. I suggest having at least two team meetings every week, one
with your advisor (main meeting) and one without them (student meeting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;main-meeting&#34;&gt;Main meeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the main meeting, every student should be prepared with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short weekly update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical challenges faced during the assigned task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions or gotchas found during the assigned the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the main meeting, each student should leave with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At least one assigned task for the week. This can be a paper to read and explain, feature to implement, or a theorem to prove.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good sense of where to look for answers to their questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of students (myself included) struggle with prioritizing tasks. Students
involved in research have tons of unstructured time which is not utilized
effectively without a good plan. Assigned tasks help me focus on a task that
I need to get done every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concretely, I try every week to either complete the tasks assigned to me or
have technical questions that are blocking me ready for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;student-meeting&#34;&gt;Student meeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student meetings are more informal and are meant for in depth discussions
about small issues that team members are facing in completing their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;codebases&#34;&gt;Codebases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working on an applied systems project chances are you are building
a software artifact. Regardless of how many people are writing code, it is useful to
check in the code into &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source
control&lt;/a&gt;. This makes the code
publicly viewable and commentable by the team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level principle behind these guidelines is to minimize the number of locations where critical information such as feature discussions are kept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I primarily use &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rachitnigam&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, the following guidelines assume your
project is Github-based. When working on a artifact, I have the following
expectations with team members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The project leaders (graduate students or senior undergrads) should have a
good sense of what is going on with every aspect of the codebase. This means
having a high-level understanding of all pull requests and issue discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pull requests&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-branches&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;branches&lt;/a&gt;. Working
on big features on a separate branch allows other people to work in parallel
while leaving the code in a buildable state. Pull requests are a great way
to get the team&amp;rsquo;s attention on a big change and center discussions around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the git history clean by using &lt;code&gt;git pull -r&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-rebase&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rebasing&lt;/a&gt; instead of
merging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;todo-list&#34;&gt;TODO List&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most of my projects revolve around a software artifact, most of which
are on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rachitnigam&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, I use Github issues as
a tracking list. Other people I have worked with also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; or one of the dozens of TODO apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The todo list should make it easy to create tasks and have discussions around them and also allow team members to see who is working on what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the development phase of the project, I ask the team to use
issues liberally. The term &amp;ldquo;global tracker&amp;rdquo; refers to the high level view of
all todo items. On Github, this is simply the issues page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Largely, I divide issues into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trackers&lt;/strong&gt;. Trackers are a collection of smaller issues that logically belong
together but might pollute the global tracker. Use these for reading lists,
benchmark status, and low priority tasks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cucapra/seashell/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=is%3Aissue+label%3ATracker+&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;. Proposal are the heart of the global tracker. Use proposals to
discuss system features, implementation sketches, or big bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;: These include questions or small bugs. These should be
high frequency, i.e. created liberally, and answered quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conflict-resolution&#34;&gt;Conflict resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an often overlooked dimension of team dynamics. Research projects can
often be stressful, especially since students tend to be ambitious and prone
to overworking. Since this process so highly dependent on the team members
and project leads, my guideline can only be personalized for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a team member feels under too much pressure to do something or dislikes
someone&amp;rsquo;s personal behavior, they can either directly contact the person or
ask one of the team leads to mediate. While daunting, it is much better in the
long run to have frank discussions about team expectations and stresses instead
of letting things get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are several industrial strength methodologies for team managements,
I like having a much more lightweight team management style. A lot of research
is about exploring new ideas and pursuing crazy ideas. Regardless of which
guidelines you choose to follow, they should not take away the joy of programming
or research!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning to Fail</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I often describe the basic philosphy of research using a metaphor.  I find
research to be like head bashing a wall over and over till you find a way to
break it and then repeating it ad nauseam.  Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll know where the
cracks in the wall are, and sometime you&amp;rsquo;ll know what angle you need to hit the
wall with your head, but fundamentally, you&amp;rsquo;re hitting your head into a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not be a precise description of how research works for everyone, but
my views are shaped by my experience at research and other researchers who
surround me. The single most important take away I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from these is
to expect failure and to work hard regardless. These two things are not always
easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate my viewpoint, and to demonstrate how I became such a tortured
soul, here&amp;rsquo;s a run down of my experience as an undergraduate researcher:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;spring-2016&#34;&gt;Spring 2016&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out a my undergraduate advisor in my first semester after being
fascinated with scheme &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After some back and forth, I quickly started
a project. The project was to build a formal semantics for bash scripts. The
bash specification is large and complicated with a lot of subtle interactions.
The particular phase we were interested in formalizing were the bash shell
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;expansions&lt;/a&gt;. We tried to build a Hoare logic style semantics for the expansion, because
we wanted to ultimately verify properties of these shell scripts. Unfortunately,
I showed that such a semantics becomes super complicated and we abandoned the
project &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A few weeks into research and I had already failed a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;summer-2016&#34;&gt;Summer 2016&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back for the summer and started working on a new, and slightly related
project. The idea was to extend previous work on &lt;a href=&#34;https://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/papers/2016-rehearsal.html&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;verifying Puppet
manifests&lt;/a&gt; to
capture the semantics of snippets of shell programs people write into their
Puppet manifests. The previous work had modeled Puppet programs using a
small core calculus based on a Kleene Algebra with Tests (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/Papers/kat.pdf&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KAT&lt;/a&gt;) and we wanted to create an active learning
mechanism to learn the underlying automaton by running the shell script in
a docker container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of background in either automata theory or
the low level details of system call tracing (which was the core mechanism to
figure out what system calls were being used). I spent half of the summer
jumping back and forth between learning about automata theory and systems and
implementing papers without much to show for it. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this
at the time, this project also fizzled out around this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason the project fizzled out was because I joined another students
project that had to do with automatically synthesizing updates for Puppet
manifests by capturing system calls &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I worked on this project for the rest
of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;fall-2016&#34;&gt;Fall 2016&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the summer ended, my advisor proposed joining Fission, another project that
I had been interested in from the start of my summer. This project aimed to
build a single-tiered, secure programming model for writing web applications.
People on the project had built a frontend that could take JavaScript code and
compile it into something that could enforces security conditions.
Around the same time, the Puppet synthesis project slowed down because the
first author was applying to graduate schools and I was focusing more on
Fission.  Eventually, I stopped working on this project entirely and even
though it was eventually published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cap off the depressing string of half completed projects, it was around this
time I actually had minor clinical depression and my productivity collapsed. After
attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2016&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICFP &amp;lsquo;16&lt;/a&gt; I decided to
start therapy to &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; my clinical depression &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we also published a &lt;a href=&#34;http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7124/pdf/LIPIcs-SNAPL-2017-5.pdf&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;workshop
paper&lt;/a&gt;
on Fission. Unfortunately, after several rewrites of the compiler, people
leaving the project, and fundamental performance issues, it was becoming
painfully clear that Fission would not pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not keeping track, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for failed projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;spring-2017&#34;&gt;Spring 2017&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While making slow progress on Fission, my advisor asked a new question, &amp;ldquo;What
would it take to build a client-side IDE?&amp;ldquo;. In order to build this IDE, we
started investigating different compiler frameworks for JavaScript. We built
multiple passes to simplify JavaScript constructs and around the same time, another
graduate student joined the project. This spring was perhaps the most productive
semester of my undergraduate research career. I had gained enough technical
and programming chops to push on the project without hands-on support. By the
end of this semester, we had managed to build an IDE and give a talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;afterward&#34;&gt;Afterward&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept pushing on this project with the grad student and published a paper
in &lt;a href=&#34;https://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2018&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PLDI &amp;lsquo;18&lt;/a&gt;. I also applied to
graduate schools and decided to start my PhD at Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, there are several important things I came to appreciate about
my undergraduate research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I failed for more than a year, I learned &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. The finite model
theory I learned in my first summer is seeing use in my current research. The
amount of implementation work I did made me good at rapid prototyping and
debugging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infectious optimism of my advisor kept me going through all the failures.
In hindsight, perhaps the most important piece of advice he gave me was,
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll figure it out!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing I learned from my advisor was that sticking to a research agenda,
even when things look absymal, is the way to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I learned that researchers are completely unproductive when they&amp;rsquo;re sad.
Concretely, this means that I shy away from projects where I&amp;rsquo;m the only student.
Surrounding myself with people I like to work with and can bounce ideas with
is how I make progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I summarized these ideas to a friend was that research sometimes
requires a religious amount of faith and hard work before you can see any progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PhD @ Cornell: The Free Agent system</title>
      <link>/post/free-agent-cornell/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Deciding which graduate school you&amp;rsquo;re going to spend the next &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; years of your
life is one of the hardest decision of your life. One of the things
that made is hard for me was deciding between Cornell and my other
top choice was Cornell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Free agent system&amp;rdquo;. Here is a short post about what
the system is and why it worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;graduate-school-admissions&#34;&gt;Graduate School Admissions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most schools in the US, when you apply to a PhD program, students are usually
picked out by one or more professors who think you&amp;rsquo;d be a good fit. After
visiting the school, the student decides which professor they want to work with
and commit to the school. When the student starts at the school, they are
funded by the professor and they start doing great things together. However,
some schools don&amp;rsquo;t follow this system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;cornell-s-free-agent-system&#34;&gt;Cornell&amp;rsquo;s Free Agent System&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Cornell, and a few other schools, the admission process looks a bit
different.  When a PhD student is admitted to Cornell, they are are &lt;em&gt;admitted
to the department&lt;/em&gt;, which highlights Cornell&amp;rsquo;s commitment towards the student&amp;rsquo;s
academic freedom. Concretely, this means that Cornell guarantees funding,
usually through teaching assistantship, for the student without tying them to
an advisor [^1].  This is supposed to allow the students to explore and talk to
potential advisors without being worried about funding. This is the Free Agent
system at Cornell. Students are free agents till they decide who they want to
work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cornell&amp;rsquo;s free agent system was devised when the department was young and the
incoming PhD students tended to have comparatively less research experience.
The free agent system allowed students to explore different areas without
being pressured into working on topics they might disliked. However, in the recent
years, the makeup of people applying to PhD programs has drastically changed &amp;mdash;
students tend to come in with a lot more research experience and are usually
quite certain about the area they want to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the CS department is also structured in a way that assumes
students are free agents their first year. This means that they are expected to
&lt;del&gt;take a lot of classes and&lt;/del&gt; [^1] be teaching assistants (TAs) in their first
two semesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-experience&#34;&gt;My Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free agent system caused me a lot of angst during the decision process. For
some background, I had started doing programming languages (PL) research in the
first semester of my undergraduate degree and was certain about my future research
direction. Furthermore, I knew that Cornell was the best fit for my interest in
doing PL work at the intersection of other fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was also afraid of not being able to find an advisor. After
about 6 hours of post visit day talks with professors and students in the PL
group, I decided to go to Cornell. Even after my acceptance, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if
I&amp;rsquo;d be able to find an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started in Fall, I emailed professors in the PL group to set up
meetings. This is where I found the true strength of the free agent system.
Since professors expect students to go talk to a lot of people, they expect and
often encourage students to do research rotations with professors they are
interested in working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes it easy to reach out to professors and learn about their work. I
cannot emphasize how important it is to me to learn about and have
conversations about research in different domains. One of my goals going into a
PhD is to have a broad sense of the different kinds of problems in different
domains and having access to professors in different areas makes it easy to do
so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also able to start working with my awesome advisor &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adrian
Sampson&lt;/a&gt; and we quickly found a project
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;caveat-emptor&#34;&gt;Caveat Emptor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the free agent system caused me some anguish in the decision process, it
was not the primary reason I decided join Cornell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My primary motivators were research that excited me, and people &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; who are
just as excited about it as me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first year TAing requirement causes some amount of stress for
new students. However, the department is aware of the issues and is
trying to move away from this system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is a more &lt;a href=&#34;http://jxyzabc.blogspot.com/2009/02/some-notes-on-picking-grad.html&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;detailed
post&lt;/a&gt; from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://jeanyang.com/&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jean Yang&lt;/a&gt; on what considerations matter when deciding
on schools. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;Importantly, This includes other grad students. Remember, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be spending a lot more time with other grad students than you will with faculty.

      <title>Don&#39;t be Programming Languages researchers</title>
      <link>/post/pl-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 21:52:05 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/pl-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of being a judgement of what PL research should be, this short post is
simply a reflection of my research interests and what role PL plays into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a recent PLDG talk, the speaker said, &amp;ldquo;I think that, as a community, PL
people have a moral responsibility to step in and say, No, you&amp;rsquo;re having fun
wrong!&amp;rdquo; While I have no qualms about the comment itself (researchers should be
able to not take themselves seriously sometimes), it led me to think about the
way PL research is applied in new domains. The speaker usually starts with an
overview of the domain and talks about the current state of the art of
programming languages and tools in it. They then go on to point out that most
tools and languages fail to make use of some amazing and well known PL
technique. Then they describe their work which applies the aforementioned PL
technique and build cool and interesting language abstractions with the promise
of building better and improved tools for the domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I strongly endorse PL techniques and research being applied in new
domains, this story demonstrates a fundamental issue for me: Application of PL techniques is
done retrospectively. PL researchers are not there when a domain is shaping up
and people trying to build tools and programming languages for that domain.
Only once people have made build these tools, which in turn cement
themselves into domain, do PL researchers come into the scene and apply their
cool techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is my solution: We should stop being PL researchers. Or put in a more
nuanced manner, PL researchers should take it upon themselves to specialize
heavily into new domains and apply PL techniques in those domains. Programming
languages are the most fundamental way of communicating intent to computers. As
PL researchers, we should be helping people from other domains to do this
exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
