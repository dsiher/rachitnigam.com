Hi, I'm Rachit Nigam. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in computer science and Mathematics
at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://umass.edu) and am slated to graduate
in May 2019.

My research interests lie in the domain of programming languages, with a focus on
building tools that enhance programming experience while giving strong
mathematical guarantees. More details about my research can be found [here](./research.html).

I am currently working with [Dr. Arjun Guha](https://people.cs.umass.edu/arjun) in the
[PLASMA](https://plasma.cs.umass.edu) research group as a research assistant. My current project
is [Fission](https://github.com/plasma-umass/fission), a dynamic tier-splitting tool for web
applications.
