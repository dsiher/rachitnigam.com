Hi, I'm Rachit Nigam. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science
and Mathematics at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://umass.edu) and
am slated to graduate in May 2018.

My research focus lies in understanding semantics and building programming
abstractions. In pursuit of this goal, I work on everything from [compilers for
JavaScript](https://github.com/plasma-umass/stopify) to Bisimulation proofs.
More details about research projects can be found [here](./research.html)

I am spending this summer at [Brown University](https://brown.edu) working with
[Prof. Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/). During the academic
year, I work with [Prof. Arjun Guha](https://people.cs.umass.edu/arjun) in the
[PLASMA](https://github.com/plasma-umass) research group.
