Hi, I'm Rachit Nigam. I am currently pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science
and Mathematics at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://umass.edu) and
am slated to graduate in May 2018.

My research interests lie in the domain of programming languages, with a focus
on building tools that enhance programming experience while giving strong
mathematical guarantees. More details about my research can be found
[here](./research.html).

I am currently working with [Prof. Arjun
Guha](https://people.cs.umass.edu/arjun) in the
[PLASMA](https://plasma.cs.umass.edu) research group as a research assistant.
My current project is [Fission](https://github.com/plasma-umass/fission), a
dynamic tier-splitting tool for web applications.
