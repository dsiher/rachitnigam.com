      <description>With the end of the Spring 2020 semester a month away, I have spent almost two academic years at Cornell. A quick rundown of everything that happened:

Rejected from Microsoft research internship for summer 2019. Rejected from Qualcomm fellowship application in 2019. Rejected from the Facebook fellowship in 2019.</description>

      <description>I often describe the basic philosophy of research using a metaphor: bash your head in a wall over and over till you find a way to break it and then repeat it ad nauseam. Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll know where the cracks in the wall are, and sometime you&amp;rsquo;ll know what angle you need to hit the wall with your head, but fundamentally, you&amp;rsquo;re hitting your head into a wall.
This is perhaps an unnecessarily graphic description of what research is like but the point I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get across is that research is hard and that failure is the expected outcome.</description>
