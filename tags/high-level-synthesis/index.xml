      <description>A TLDR on why you should care. FPGAs, a form of reconfigurable architectures, already power a large number of datacenter applications. With FPGA acceleration becoming mainstream, it is the perfect opportunity to think about programming models for designing next-generation high-performance hardware.
 Moore&amp;rsquo;s law is in its death throes. With Global Foundries announcing that they are no longer pursuing 7nm production nodes, fabrication companies focusing on incremental improvements, and the end of the arguably more important Dennard scaling, we&amp;rsquo;re entering a new era where general purpose architectures are no longer the solution.</description>
